Filter Samples

This project shows you how to create a filter plugin. It involves three files:

  FilterAddon.java - returns your addon, which allows users to turn it on or off
  FilterExposer.java - returns your filters
  AndroidManifest.xml - receives Astrid's requests and sends appropriate stuff
